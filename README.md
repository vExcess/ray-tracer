# ray-tracer
Just a toy ray tracer written in Zig

# Info
Run `make` to build the project in debug mode, `make release` to build the project in release mode, and `make run` to run the built project.  
Make sure you SDL installed on your system.  
If you don't want to compile it yourself I have provided the compiled executable for x86_64 linux in zigout/bin.  
There are still a lot of optimizations I need to do so it's pretty slow right now.
