# ray-tracer
Just a toy ray tracer written in Zig

# Info
This project uses [jvbuild](https://github.com/vExcess/jvbuild).

Install dependencies: `jvbuild install`  
Run in debug mode: `jvbuild run`  
Run with optimizations: `jvbuild run -O=fast`  

Replace `run` with `build` to compile the project without running it. 

My raytracer is really slow right now. I need to figure out what optimizations I can do.
